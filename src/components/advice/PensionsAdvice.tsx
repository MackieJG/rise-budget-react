                The first piece of advice is start saving into a pension as soon as possible.
                In Scotland if you are over 21 there is automatic enrollment into your workplace pension scheme.
                If you are under 21 you will have to opt in. It is recommended to start saving as soon as possible.

                The maximum state pension in 2022/23 is £185.15 per week or £9,628 per year!
                This is a lot less than than most people hope to retire on.
